- **Beat your previous high score**

## üéØ Game Controls

### **Finger-Based Controls** (Unified/Enhanced Games)
- **1 finger** = Move right
- **2 fingers** = Move left
- **3+ fingers** = Jump
- **Fist gesture** = Double jump (if available)
- **Open palm** = Special move

### **Palm-Based Controls** (Palm-Controlled Game)
- **Palm on left side** = Move left
- **Palm on right side** = Move right
- **Palm in center + large** = Jump
- **No finger counting needed**

### **Keyboard Controls**
- **P** = Pause game
- **Q** = Quit game
- **Arrow Keys** = Navigate menus
- **Enter** = Select menu option
- **Escape** = Back/Resume

## üéÅ Power-ups

### **üü£ Double Jump** (Magenta)
- **Effect**: Allows double jumping
- **Duration**: 10 seconds
- **Visual**: Magenta square with circle

### **üü° Speed Boost** (Yellow)
- **Effect**: Increases movement and game speed
- **Duration**: 5 seconds
- **Visual**: Yellow square with arrow

### **üîµ Shield** (Cyan)
- **Effect**: Protects from one obstacle hit
- **Duration**: 8 seconds
- **Visual**: Cyan square with shield effect

### **üü£ Time Slow** (Purple)
- **Effect**: Slows down game time
- **Duration**: 3 seconds
- **Visual**: Purple square

## üìä Scoring System

### **Milestone Scoring**
- **+50 points** every 5 obstacles passed
- **+25 points** for each power-up collected
- **High score tracking** with persistent storage

### **Score Display**
- **Current score** shown in real-time
- **High score** displayed when available
- **Milestone notifications** in console

## üîß Technical Details

### **Detection Methods**

#### **OpenCV Detection**
- **Skin color segmentation** with multiple HSV ranges
- **Contour analysis** for hand detection
- **Convexity defects** for finger counting
- **Performance optimized** with frame skipping

#### **MediaPipe Detection** (if available)
- **21 hand landmarks** for precise tracking
- **Real-time hand pose** estimation
- **Advanced gesture recognition**
- **Higher accuracy** but requires MediaPipe library

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Camera Not Working**
```
[ WARN:0@1.470] global cap_msmf.cpp:476 videoio(MSMF): OnReadSample() is called with error status
```
- **Solution**: This is normal on Windows, doesn't affect gameplay
- **Alternative**: Try different camera index in code

#### **Hand Detection Issues**
- **Problem**: Hand not detected properly
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure good lighting
  - Position hand clearly in camera view
  - Try different detection method
  - Adjust skin color ranges if needed

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Problem**: Low FPS or laggy controls
- **Solutions**:
  - Use optimized game version
  - Reduce camera resolution
  - Close other applications
  - Use palm-controlled game for better performance

#### **MediaPipe Not Available**
```
MediaPipe not available - Using OpenCV hand detection
```
- **Solution**: This is normal, game will use OpenCV detection
- **To install MediaPipe**: `pip install mediapipe` (may not work on Python 3.13)

### **System Requirements**
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Python**: 3.8 - 3.11 (MediaPipe), 3.8+ (OpenCV)
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Camera**: Any webcam with 640x480 or higher resolution

## üéØ Tips for Best Experience

### **Lighting**
- **Good lighting** is crucial for hand detection
- **Avoid backlighting** (bright windows behind you)
- **Use consistent lighting** throughout gameplay

### **Hand Positioning**
- **Keep hand clearly visible** in camera frame
- **Avoid rapid movements** for better detection
- **Use consistent gestures** for reliable controls

### **Performance**
- **Close unnecessary applications** for better FPS
- **Use palm-controlled game** for best performance
- **Position camera at eye level** for optimal detection

### **Game Strategy**
- **Collect power-ups** for higher scores
- **Use shield strategically** for difficult sections
- **Time your jumps** to avoid obstacles
- **Practice gesture recognition** for better control
